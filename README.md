# Churn-Prediction-Model
üîç Churn Prediction Model ‚Äì Internee.pk Internship Task 3
This project is part of my internship with Internee.pk, where I built a machine learning model to predict customer churn using a sample telecom dataset. The primary objective is to identify customers who are at risk of leaving a service and help businesses take proactive retention measures.

üìä Project Overview:
The dataset includes customer information such as:

Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents

Service Information: Contract type, Payment method, Tenure

Billing Data: Monthly and Total Charges

Churn Status: Whether the customer has left or stayed

üß† Machine Learning Pipeline:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handled categorical variables using LabelEncoder

Model Training

Trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn

Model Evaluation

Evaluated with Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

üìÅ Files Included:
telecom_churn_data.csv: Simulated customer dataset

Churn_Prediction_Model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis

classification_report.csv: Model evaluation metrics

confusion_matrix.png: Visualization of true vs. predicted outcomes

model_accuracy.txt: Accuracy of the model

README.md: Documentation of the project

This project helped me understand how real-world data and machine learning can be used to solve important business problems like customer retention.

Feel free to explore the notebook and outputs!
